    <p>
        Ready-to-eat pizza is a convenient and 
        delicious meal option that requires no preparation or cooking. 
        These pizzas come pre-cooked and often pre-sliced, 
        making them perfect for quick meals or snacks.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Crust: Made from wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, and sometimes oil or sugar.</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce: A base sauce made from tomatoes, garlic, herbs</li>
        <li>Cheese: Usually mozzarella cheese, but can include others like cheddar</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: Sometimes drizzled on top for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Herbs and Seasonings: Oregano, basil, garlic powder,</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps of preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: In a bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.<br>
            In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, and olive oil. Pour the yeast mixture into this bowl and mix until a dough forms.<br>
            Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.<br>
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
        </li>
        
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a saucepan, heat some olive oil and sauté minced garlic until fragrant.<br>
            Add crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, dried oregano, and basil. Simmer for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the highest setting, usually around 475-500°F (245-260°C).<br>
            If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats to get it nice and hot.
        </li>
        
        <li>Shape the Dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.<br>
            On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle or your desired shape, around 12 inches in diameter for a standard pizza.<br>
            You can use your hands to stretch the dough if you prefer a more rustic look.
        </li>
        
        <li>Assemble the Pizza: Place the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.<br>
            Spread a thin layer of prepared sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.<br>
            Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.<br>
            Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni slices, black olives, green bell peppers, and fresh basil leaves.
        </li>
        
        <li>Bake the Pizza: Slide the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.<br>
            Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        </li>
        
        <li>Finish and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven using a pizza peel or oven mitts. Let it cool for a minute or two.<br>
            Slice the pizza using a pizza cutter.<br>
            Serve hot, garnished with extra basil leaves if desired. Enjoy your homemade pizza!
